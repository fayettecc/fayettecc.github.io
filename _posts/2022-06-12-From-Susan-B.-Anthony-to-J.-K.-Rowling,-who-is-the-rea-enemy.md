**“What** arrogance…to put the question, what shall we do with a race of men and women who have fed, clothed and supported both themselves and their oppressors for centuries…the only way to solve the race question; educate blacks to be equal to their opportunities, whites to be willing to share their privileges” [1], written by Susan B. Anthony in 1866, claimed that white education would provide equal opportunities for blacks using an assimilationist tone. “If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives” [2], said J. K. Rowling in 2020, excluded transgender individuals from strict categories of male and female. As victims of a patriarchal society, two feminists from different eras appear to make the same assessment of the rest of the political movement, namely that feminism should take precedence over all other social movements. In a culture where patriarchy prevails, the question arises as to whether the system itself or other egalitarians constitute the greatest threat to feminism.

_History of Susan B. Anthony_

As a great and maybe the greatest feminist in the history of the United States, Susan B. Anthony is famous for her dedication to the Nineteenth Amendment, which is about women’s suffrage [3]. However, when looking back in history, it is found that the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), which was founded in 1866 after the Civil War, was de facto dissolved in 1869. The primary reason for the dissolution of the group was a rift between those individuals whose primary focus was on the advancement of women’s rights and those individuals whose primary focus was on the promotion of African American civil rights [4]. At a critical meeting in May 1869, Federico Douglas, a well-respected abolitionist activist, argued that AERA should continue to fight for women’s suffrage while supporting the 15th Amendment. In the meantime, Elizabeth Stanton, Anthony’s most loyal ally and friend in the pre-movement period, not only disagreed with him, but delivered a speech about male immigrants and racist stereotypes of formerly enslaved men, professed that “Think of Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a monarchy and a republic, who never read the Declaration of Independence, or Webster’s spelling book, making laws for Lydia Marie Child, Lucretia Mott or Fanny Kemble” [5].

In addition, Stanton and Anthony also stood for the slogan “woman first and negro last,” and helped scandal-ridden George Train run for president of the United States in exchange for his funding of a feminist newspaper [6][5]. This debate resulted not only in the disintegration of AERA but also in a schism within the women’s suffrage movement between those who favor the 15th Amendment and those who do not, into two new organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), which only fought for women suffrage, and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which fought both for women suffrage and African American suffrage [4]. Contrary to Susan B. Anthony, who sought to distance her work from him, Douglass continued to strive for equal rights for all Americans. To make matters worse, Anthony and Stanton publicly engaged white supremacists such as Belle Kearney [5].

_Criticism on J. K. Rowling_

“‘Feminazi’, ‘TERF’, ‘bitch’, ‘witch’. Times change. Woman-hate is eternal” [7], published by J. K. Rowling in 2020, perceived the verbal assault on her forceful speech on LGBTQ society as an attack on women due to her transphobia. As a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), she opposes the claim that trans-women are women as well as the exclusion of trans-women from female areas and hostility to trans rights [8]. She also rejects the full humanity of transgender individuals and goes against the scientific realities about gender and sexuality that are acknowledged in today’s medical community [9]. In her blog about speaking out, she claimed, “so I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe” [10], suggesting that transgender equality exists to oppress the perception of celibate women.

_Who is the real enemy?_

Are African-American women and transgender women the real enemies of cisgender women? It doesn't appear so. However, the rationale behind why feminists of the past and present should view them as the adversary of women's access to equal rights is something that deserves significant consideration. I maintain my ignorance and hope that a specialist will be able to address this question and clarify my article.
