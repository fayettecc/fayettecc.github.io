Women's Fashion as Political Changes from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich

Fashion is inherently political because it reflects the times. Women's fashion changed dramatically between the Weimar Republic and the Nazi Third Reich. However, the relationship between politics and women's fashion from the 1920s to the 1940s has received little academic attention. In the foreground of the essay is a study of women's fashion and Weimar parliamentary politics in the Weimar Republic. Built on the ruins of the Second Reich, the Weimar parliament had a wide range of political parties for individuals with different identities ("Weimar Political Parties"). Women's representation in the Weimar Republic's parliament (Todd 655) helped secure and strengthen women's rights. Meanwhile, women's fashion proliferated during the period (Ganeva 21, _Women in Weimar fashion_), especially within Jewish society (Wallach 113). The essay then examines the political and cultural developments, as well as changes in women's fashion that occurred in Germany after the Nazi take-over. The uncontrolled expansion of political parties helped Adolf Hitler's capacity to grab power, resulting in the gradual abolishment of political parties ("Weimar Political Parties"). Aryan reproductive machines rather than autonomous persons, women were portrayed as such in propaganda within the Third Reich (Guenther 94), which achieved a lower social status (Stephenson 329). By making the comparison, it is straightforward that Weimar German women's dress evolved in lockstep with the Third Reich due to the change in the political environments. Women's elevated status and considerable involvement in the congress resulted in their significant contribution to developing and popularizing Weimar Germany's mainstream fashion styles. In addition, the degradation of women's standing as a result of political change resulted in women losing their voice in politics, further expanding to fashion, and being forced to conform to the masculinity of Nazi males. In this context, the essay highlights the argument: that changes in the political field from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich resulted in changes in women's fashion.

WEIMAR GOLDEN AGE

Apart from the presence of Elisabeth of Bavaria (VanDemark 2) and Maria Theresa (Yonan 14), when the Frankish king Clovis formalized the Salic Law, Germanic women generally lived under male despotism and were treated as subordinates and dependents by their male counterparts (Taylor 363). However, following the collapse of the Second Reich, the Weimar Republic unexpectedly codified its constitution by granting women the right to vote (Articles 17 and 22) due to vast demonstrations for women's suffrage (Todd 655), equality between men and women in civil matters (Article 109), non-discrimination against female bureaucrats (Article 128), maternity rights (Article 19), and equality of spouses in marriage (Article 119) ("Weimar Constitution"). Women's engagement in politics was boosted due to the liberalization measures that followed; a stunning 82 percent of women voted in the 1919 National Assembly election. According to official figures, they held 10% of the seats (Woodfin 91). Meanwhile, the abolition of censorship also allowed for the publication and circulation of controversial information both politically and sexually (Beetham 123).

It was also beginning to shift the status of women in the work sector. Women began to take on new employment previously dominated by males, such as administration. Tram conductors and department shop clerks, for example, as well as manufacturing employees, attorneys, and physicians, are examples of people who work in service industries. Likewise, thriving were vocations historically associated with women, such as teaching, social work, and secretarial work (Todd 655). When the war ended in 1918, more than 11 million women were working in Germany, accounting for 36% of the country's entire social employment (D. Peukert 127).

Women's status in society began to transform as they obtained more significant influence in society and government (Todd 656):

"…, Social observers of all political persuasions—from journalists and sociologists to government experts and political leaders—detected the emergence of a "new woman" and a "new family" in the 1920s. Indeed, Weimar culture did produce a certain heady and intoxicating sense of freedom in the big cities, especially for some intellectual and professional women, …" (Bridenthal et al. 105)

The Weimar Republic was a period of transformation when the country transitioned from war to peace, when politics shifted radically, and when the position of women in society shifted from the conventional gender role of focusing on the family to that of a contemporary woman capable of supporting herself. Women gained further rights under the Weimar Constitution in areas such as professional and family law, and they finally gained the right to vote under the same conditions as males under the Weimar Constitution. Magazines and newspapers issued warnings about the possibility of gender role reversals in fashion against this changing environment. In "The Masculinization of Women," a 1924 article for BIZ, the author claimed the ancient right of women to flirt with fashion and saw the playful appropriation of men's clothing as a legitimate expression of women's clothing (Beetham 124). According to Sutton, a style called "Bubikopf," "an umbrella term for women's short haircuts that could range in style from a chin-length pageboy bob to a tightly cropped 'Eton'" (27), is one of the most popular and controversial masculine women fashion in the Weimar Republic. It is described as "an epoch-making, astonishing twentieth-century cultural phenomenon, which is quite deservedly moving the entire 'ladies' world" ("Etwas Vom Bubikopfe").

"The ideal of beauty evolves with style," BIZ asserted in 1925 (qtd. in Sutton 29), citing journalists from across the media spectrum who directly linked the aesthetic masculinization of women to the industrialization and modernization of German society, which included a trend toward more gender equality. During this period, more and more young women adopted the new look as their daily uniform. Boyish hairstyles, sleek and loose clothes, slim ankles displayed in sports or dance, slim silhouettes, all these elements made up the image of the new woman, the flap, the costume, or the Knabin (qtd. in Eichstedt). However, the surge in popularity of masculine female fashion as a result of political change has led to inconsistent reactions from the wider populace. In 1925, for example, an article in Biz stated that "Time has turned us into independent women who can look after ourselves; our lives are becoming increasingly similar to men; the Bubikopf is no whim of fashion, but rather is a manifestation of a new cultural era," (qtd. in Sutton 30) while another article in Biz published a photograph of five short-haired athletic women wearing lightly knitted sweaters in the same year that the Bubikopf was introduced. A shot of five short-haired sporty women in lightly knitted knitwear competing in an archery tournament was published by BIZ in the same year, prompting a controversial question from a reader contest: "How many guys were present?" Not unexpectedly, the response informs us that nearly all of them are females in the workforce ("Wieviel Männer Sind Hier Dabei?"). In general, the disruption of the gender order due to political upheaval - in terms of women's appearance, attitudes toward employment, and wartime social authority is increasingly regarded as an abnormality that needs to be rectified in order for things to return to "normal."

In addition, a highly expressive and influential venue for Weimar women's fashion was film and theater (Ganeva 292, _Weimar Film as Fashion Show)_. On the one hand, masculine women's fashion could also be represented from the perspective. Kino Lorber, a famous Drag King, defined by Judith Halberstamin his book _Mackdaddy, Superfly, Rapper_ as "a performer who pinpoints and exploits the obscured theatricality and masculinity" (104) in the Weimar regime, had performed masculine characters in the following three movies: Michael (1924), Mädchen in Uniform (1931) and Victor and Victoria (1933). This boom in cool fashion also has to do with the Weimar Republic's relatively hands-off policing (NPR) of gay and transgender people (Rüß 241).

On the other hand, fashion comedies abound in Berlin throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, and they are still going strong today. According to an article published in Frankfurter Zeitung, despite its strong roots in capitalism and consumer culture, film as a mass medium has the potential to play an essential part in the process of cultural democratization (Kracauer). Their exhibits included enticing venues, activities, and items linked with the modern lifestyle - fancy salons, expensive retail shops, runway shows, and stylish apparel, to name a few examples (Guenther). At the same time, Weimar women work outside the home, have limited leisure time and financial resources, work in offices and are active in the public sphere, and are particularly interested in learning about the latest fabrics, designs, and hairstyles, as well as how to apply makeup and lipstick and what to wear for what occasion (Ganeva 292, _Weimar Film as Fashion Show_). Thus, female viewers may satiate their curiosity most straightforwardly and directly imaginable by viewing films.

In essence, the act of purchasing fashion through the medium of film was unimaginable in Germany prior to the Weimar Republic. German women who went to work contributed to the fashion renaissance. The majority of women's apparel stemmed from the outfits they made for themselves while working as housewives before the Weimar Republic was established (Nolan 550). Women worked in a wide variety of social roles during the war and the postwar era, leaving them with little time to sew their own clothes, which resulted in a widespread tendency toward purchasing "Konfektion," that is, ready-to-wear during the period (Guenther).

Weimar female fashion was also particularly strongly connected with Jewish women, who, with the introduction of the Weimar Constitution, significantly improved social standing than they had previously indicated in Germany. Jewish women in Weimar Germany played an essential role in developing and popularizing mainstream fashion trends in numerous ways. For example, they were significantly overrepresented among fashion journalists. They held a prominent position among designers as well as fashion photographers (Wallach 115). In addition, as early as the mid-1800s, when the concept of fashionable clothing had already spread to the middle and even lower urban classes, Jewish-owned garment companies such as Mannheimer, David Leib Levin, Rudolph Hertzog, and Hermann Gerson established a rationalized manufacturing process for men's and women's apparel; they also opened department stores selling not only high fashion but also sewing patterns and clothing in fixed sizes and at relatively affordable prices films (Ganeva 291, _Weimar Film as Fashion Show_). By the 1920s, Berlin's fashion industry was on par with or even better than that of Paris. A total of about 100,000 people worked for Jewish fashion enterprises with headquarters in the city (Chelsea). When it came to generating Jewish headlines, the fashion industry's success was so instinctive that the concept of high fashion was deemed part of Jewish culture. However, these enterprises do more than creating garments for Jewish clients; they also define trends and manufacture clothing for the general public (Wallach 115).

Regina Friedländer, a female hat designer, is an excellent example of a female Jewish designer who has achieved significant success. In the 1920s, her work was influential to a wide range of people, including readers of women's fashion magazines, well-dressed Berlin consumers, costume designers working in theater and film, those interested in architecture and design, and those who saw a connection between art and fashion, among others (Greenspoon). Her main salon in Potsdamer Platz stayed open until 1936 when it was most likely forced to cease due to financial constraints (Wallach 116).

Through the above, a conclusion can be drawn that women's fashion flourished as never before in Weimar Germany until Hitler came to power in the context of political change.

NAZI DARK AGE

Generally, the Nazi leadership was diverse in its aggressiveness toward women's right to self-determination in politics. To begin with, Hitler's government tried to exclude women from politics. As soon as the Nazis came to power, the struggle against the lack of children began, focusing first on the emancipation of women. From Hitler's perspective, it was necessary to eliminate it from public life at all costs, forcing it to return to the family according to the old theory of the three K's said by the former emperor William II of Germany: Küche, Kinder, Kirche, that is, kitchen, children, and church. In this regressive vein, when women gained the right to vote and fought for their liberation from male control, the National Socialist Party issued a decree in January 1921 promising to exclude women forever from any important position in the political sphere ("La Femme Sous Le Regime Nazi"). These policies stand in contradistinction to the progress made in the sectors of women's rights and gender equality during the Weimar Republic era.Political pressure and manipulating elections in Nazi Germany forced women to lose all voice in parliament. In the Nazi party's tradition, there had never been any female members of parliament. Thus, in the November 1933 general election, held in the aftermath of the Reichstag arson and in which the Nazi Party secured full parliamentary powers and prohibited any opposition party with the passage of the Enabling Act in March (Guardian staff reporter), the female members in the Weimar Parliament were reduced from thirty-seven to none (Moser-Verrey 37).

Another profitable method to eliminate the social and political status of women as well as empower the appearance that women should be in their home and focus on their marriages is propaganda. Specifically, women's political emancipation and women's entrée into traditionally male-dominated vocations and careers were viewed as grave errors that needed to be rectified. According to Rupp (371), Alfred Rosenberg, a Nazi theorist, stated that "Emancipation of the woman from the women's emancipation movement is the first demand of a generation of women who would like to save the Volk and the race … from decline and fall" (qtd. in Boger-Eichler 21). For the most part, women, as prolific mothers, child bearers, and purveyors of Nazi ideology, were deprived of almost all political power and unceremoniously thrown out of various professions that would become "wombs" (qtd. in von Groote). In addition, the Nazis weakened the political status of women by sponsoring and honoring the image of the "perfect Aryan woman." In 1939, according to the Koonz, the Third Reich awarded the "German Mother's Cross of Honor" to prolific mothers as an expression of national appreciation and recognition for their "important service" to the nation (Guenther).

When it came to women and their roles as wives and mothers in Nazi Germany, it was only appropriate to return them to the family unit into which they were born. Therefore, in the situation, women, especially Jewish women, lost their ability to take part in the fashion trend that they were highly involved in during the Weimar ages. Women working outside the home and earning money to spend on fashion products contributed to the prosperity of women's fashion in the Weimar Republic. The Nazi political propaganda program of forcing women back into the home contributed to declining women's fashion in the Third Reich. The causal relationship is readily apparent regarding political policies, as politics is a response to the times.

Not only did restricting women's participation in the fashion design process through propaganda or political means, but the Nazis also demonstrated their authority over German women's fashion and dress through the formation of theGerman Fashion Institute, which was known as "Deutsches Modeamt" by the Nazis after taking power in 1933 ("Fashion and the Third Reich"). The institute was dedicated to using German textiles, decorations, and accessories to create fashion and reflect the German women's nature and character (Guenther). Furthermore, according to Emmy Schoch, a clothing designer and seamstress, argued that the Konfektionsmode, that is, ready-to-wear fashion for women that flourished in the Weimar Republic, was an attack on the traditional role of women as instruments of fertility since it would lead to women wanting to maintain a slim figure to wear the latest styles (Fischer 275). The attack on the ready-to-wear fashion indicated that the modern fashion genre was indeed founded on anti-Semitism, associating Jews with women's fashion (as mentioned earlier, numerous ready-to-wear department stores were founded by Jews). Given the Nazi classification of Jews as an inferior race, the suppression of Weimar fashion also became a logical occurrence for the Third Reich.

However, the Nazis were trying to control all the department stores that were founded by Jewish people as well because Jewish participation in the German fashion industry was too high.Adefa, a clothing union formed after the Nazi seizure of power, aimed to bring the German fashion industry under German ownership and remove German Jews from the sector (Guenther). Although Adefa did its best to prevent Jewish people from participating in the fashion industry after the director declared "his victory over the Jews," some certain branches were still highly influenced by Jewish people; for example, the women's outerwear industry showed a 70 percent Jewish participation (qtd. in "Die 'Adefa'").

Nevertheless, the relatively liberal female fashions created by the Weimar Republic were generally wiped out. A great deal of female fashion was politically stigmatized during this period, especially Jewish design, which was vivid and bold until the 1930s; it mirrored women's growing freedom in all spheres of social life. However, the Nazis regarded these liberties and creative expression as hazardous. The confiscated fashion businesses were required to release conservative, utilitarian apparel under the new restrictions (Guenther). The designs reinforced gender expectations that women would devote their energies to creating faithful Aryans.Women's fashion was "extinguished" at this stage rather than being the result of natural social selection. In fact, the Nazis used dress codes to maintain political control and social hierarchy.

COMPARISON

In the period between the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich, it was politics, and especially political propaganda, that changed women's fashion through and through. A better proof of the argument is related to the masculine fashion of women in the Weimar Republic. As stated above, the trend thrived from the 1920s (Sutton 26) to the rise of Hitler. The propaganda of the "motherhood program" suggested that German women should wear "Trachten-kleidung," which is a kind of ancient rural women's style (Guenther). This feminine attire includes corseted gowns, shawls, and scarves (qtd in. Kirkpatrick 108).The popularity of this return to feminine women's clothing was officially endorsed. Many magazines, such as "Koralle" (Böth 11), would promote the work by featuring a young girl in this costume on their covers. In addition, the garments catered to the central theme of women returning to the home, as they were more suited to hand-sewing than to being sold as ready-to-wear (Guenther). Under this propaganda campaign, the Trachten-kleidung became the traditional and popular dress for women in Nazi Germany.

Nonetheless, as the war progressed, the Third Reich began to conscript female soldiers in accordance with incompatible Nazi values and issue them with masculine military uniforms (Grube and Richter 112).The phenomenon is paradoxical when analyzed in modern times. German women should be prolific mothers in Hitler's values, not act like soldiers. In the war's final year, female auxiliary workers made up more than half of the Wehrmacht's workforce (qtd. in von Oven 49). They fought on the front lines rather than being used as reproductive instruments at home. The result was that their fashion, or rather, the clothing they wore, was influenced by political factors and no longer represented the "Trachten-kleidung," which described the traditional German female role but rather the masculine female uniform meant a woman who was independent and self-sufficient. In this transformation, the female fashion was not spontaneously changing; instead, it was highly influenced or could be considered as being prompted by the political changes in the society of Germany. Fashion was not an independent criterion that could be evaluated the women's will for their dressing.

Nazi women in the upper echelons of society were probably the only women with the right to fashion self-determination. With her blonde hair and "icy blue eyes" (Grube 108), Magda Goebbels, the potential First Lady of the Third Reich, may seem like the perfect choice for the "perfect Aryan woman. However, being in the upper echelons of the Nazi party, she possessed numerous "vices" (Guenther) that did not fit the Nazi propaganda of women's fashion, such as her extensive use of cosmetics (Davis 136) and smoking (Bleuel 140). Furthermore, in an interview she asserted that "the German woman of the future should be stylish, beautiful and intelligent" (qtd. in D. J. K. Peukert 152).The act indeed refuted Nazi ideology, but, in the end, she received no punishment from Hitler. Yet this was a minority phenomenon that cannot be used as refuting the argument; most women living in Nazi Germany enjoyed a politically manipulated fashion.

CONCLUSION

According to Adrian Leftwich, "Politics comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation, and conflict within and between societies" (14). These activities shaped fashion, especially women's fashion, from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich. Some may argue that fashion is purely aesthetic; however, the available evidence all points amply to the fact that fashion not only has a lot to do with politics but that politics can directly manipulate fashion.

It has been closely considered and argued that Jewish designers, Jewish department stores, feminine masculine fashion, and a host of other manifestations of Weimar women's fashion stemmed from the extensive rights granted to women by the Weimar constitution, which led to the existence of "German fashion" as a symbol of pride in Europe during the Weimar Republic. In contrast, Third Reich women's fashion was shaped by the Nazi policy of the traditionalization of women and the concomitant loss of women's political rights; although influential women such as Gertrud Scholtz-Klink (Frasier 2) were active in political circles in Nazi Germany's leadership, they remained virtually invisible in the traditionally male-dominated political sphere ("Gertrud Scholtz-Klink"). Women's fashion in the Nazi Empire could be called "propaganda fashion" since it was inseparable from political propaganda. Combining all of these reflects the argument that is, changes in the political field from the Weimar Republic to the Third Reich resulted in changes in women's fashion.
