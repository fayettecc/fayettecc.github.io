**My name** is ***Fayette Hong Zhang***, and I'm a Biomedical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, where I'm now an undergraduate. I am proundly being a pledge of **Beta Theta Phi** Fraternity. Specifically, gene therapy for cancer treatment is my intended area of interest, and I have been a proud member of the **Dickerson Lab** since November 2021. I'm also interested in astronomy, mathematics and political science, to name a few topics. After graduation, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a PhD.
